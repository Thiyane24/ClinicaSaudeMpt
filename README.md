🏥 Clínica Saúde MPT - Concept Project
A vision for modern healthcare scheduling

✨ Conceptual Design - Not for Production Use

🌟 The Vision Behind the Project
Welcome to my concept design for Clínica Saúde MPT! This is a passion project exploring how we might reinvent healthcare scheduling with:

🎨 Thoughtful UI/UX - Designed for accessibility and ease

⚡ Frictionless booking - My take on simplifying appointments

🧑‍💻 Technical exploration - Playing with modern web technologies

Note: This is a frontend concept only - no backend functionality is implemented.

💡 Design Thinking
What I explored:

How might we reduce patient anxiety through UI?

What does an ideal booking flow look like?

How can we show system status clearly?

Concept limitations:

All interactions are simulated

Designed as a starting point for discussion
